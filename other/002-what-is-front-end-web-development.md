# About frontend web development

Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.

Front end development manages everything that users visually see first in their browser or application. Front end developers are responsible for the look and feel of a site. Front end development is mostly focused on what some may coin the "client side" of development.
