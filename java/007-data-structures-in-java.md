# Indroduction to Data Sturctures in Java

Data Structure is a method to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
There are many kinds of data structures, ranging from single variables to arrays or linked lists of objects containing multiple fields. All data structures can be classified as primitives or aggregates, and some are classified as containers.

The data structures in java are generally of four forms:

Linear: arrays,lists.
Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning etc.
Hash: distributed hash table, hash tree etc.
Graphs: decision, directed, acyclic etc.
